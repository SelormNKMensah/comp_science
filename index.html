          This is the Information Technology age and at its core is Computer
          Science. The study of computer science is therefore critical if
          society is to take full advantage of the benefits Information
          Technology has to offer and make rapid economic advances. Computer
          science involves the study and development of applications that allow
          for our everyday use of computers, the software systems that support
          these applications, and the means and methods used to produce both
          applications and systems that behave reliably, correctly and
          ethically. At the heart of Computer Science lies the skill of computer
          programming and employers who hire Computer Scientists expect adept
          programmers with knowledge of current techniques and tools and the
          ability to apply sound engineering principles to the development,
          construction and maintenance of computer programs.
        </h5>
        <p>
          The range of courses available in the department and the skills
          acquired by students enable them to find employment in many diverse
          fields of the economy and prepare our graduates for the computing
          industry, working in a project team (or research and development
          team), and to enable the graduate to bring specialist skills to that
          team. 
          <p>The course also provides the platform for further study or
          research through exposure to established and emerging technologies and
          methods, and to active fields of research in Computer Science. </p>
          <p>The Department offers two undergraduate degree programmes, Bachelor of
          Science in Computer Science Single-Major (3:2:1:1) and Major-Minor
          (3:2:2:1) as well as Bachelor of Science in Information Technology.</p>
